            <h3>Fitness/Bodybuilding</h3>

                <p>Fitness/Bodybuilding is probably the most favorite hobby/thing that I enjoy and have the most passion for.</p>
                <p>The reason why I enjoy working out and the fitness lifestyle itself so much, is because growing up, all my life I have struggled with body dysmorphia, anorexia, and Pectus Excavatum. Due to these complications, I have always been very insecure because of being body shamed for being skinny.</p>
                <p>I never seriously got into working out until after graduating highschool. Prior to that, I would dabble in and out and have maybe one or two workouts every 5-6 months. So it wasn't very consistent at all as I never took it serious before.</p>
                <p>However, this all changed when I got my first gym membership at a small gym called Charter Fitness, it was $10/month so the deal was very enticing to me so I took the chance and tried it out and ever since then, I've fallen in love with it.</p>
                <p>The reason why I fell in love with the gym was because it gave me a chance to sculpt my body the way I wanted to and also the consistent growth and progress over the time made it even more satisfying to see results through the amount of effort I was putting in.</p>

          <h3>Cycling</h3>

            <p>Biking was my first hobby that I fell in love with before working out came into the picture. I remember as a child all of the struggles of not being able to ride a bicycle over and over again no matter how many times I would try I was not able fully grasp the skill of riding a bicycle, I even had training wheels and would practice but it still took me a long time to actually learn how to ride one.</p>
            <p>In my own experience, the thing that finally taught me how to ride a bicycle was letting go of my fear that I couldn't do it and I wasn't capable of learning attempt after attempt. However one day I just gave it another go and took the training wheels off, had my dad help guide me through the intial push and just keep pedaling and without even noticing, I was already doing it without his help.</p>
